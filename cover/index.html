                    <p class="lead">Hello! ðŸ‘‹</p>

                    <p class="lead">My name is Adam Patterson,</p>

                    <p class="lead">I bring more than 10 years of experience and a wide range of specialties. I have
                        focused the majority of the past 6 years on building one of Canada's best performing
                        privately-owned automotive websites.</p>

                    <p class="lead">This would include innovation, custom development, web services integrations, design
                        systems, UI/UX champion, growth marketing, product analytics, and performance optimization.</p>

                    <p class="lead">I was responsible for the initial development and ongoing maintenance of Go Autos
                        main corporate site, as well as all of their dealer sites as of two years ago leading a small
                        team we managed 40+ websites running on a handful of efficiently optimized AWS servers.</p>

                    <p class="lead">We had to provide stability, fast response times, and flexibility to each site while
                        maintaining continuity and branding from the OEM as well as Go Autoâ€™s own guidelines.</p>

                    <p class="lead">There is a lot of competition in the auto industry but very few third-party vendors
                        available to Canadian dealerships. That put us at an advantage in that we controlled the entire
                        process from start to finish.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Along the way, I set up and implemented customer tracking for de-anonymization, event
                        tracking, and application analytics giving us insights into our visitors allowing for strategic
                        changes to be made.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Eventually, the success of and quantity of data we were collecting led to the
                        creation of a growth and automation team that I worked closely with.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Together we made sure that marketing and corporate needs were met, tracked, and
                        analyzed.</p>

                    <p class="lead">I take extreme pride and ownership in the work that I do and over the past decade, I
                        have worked with UX Firms, Creative Agencies, Established Products, Startups, Government, and
                        the Auto Industry.</p>

                    <p class="lead">My passion is in solving problems and connecting the dots. Using an existing,
                        third-party, or in some cases creating new tools that help solve the problem.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Testing and making changes, continually learning, and making improvements, and
                        distilling it down to the core stakeholders.</p>

                    <p class="lead">When Iâ€™m not spending my time on the computer I spend time with my wife and kids or
                        making videos for my WoodWorking YouTube channel. I am a hands-on learner and self-taught in
                        almost everything I do.</p>

                    <p class="lead">I am looking for a work environment that is supportive, empowering, inclusive,
                        respectful, and fun place to be.</p>


                    <p class="lead">Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.</p>


                    <p class="lead">Sincerely, <br>
                        Adam Patterson</p>
